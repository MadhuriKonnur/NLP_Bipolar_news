With uncertainty looming over when they will reopen their physical spaces, several restaurants in the city over the past week have decided to adapt to the new normal.The restaurants that have started deliveries are also going the extra mile to keep a skeletal staff in the kitchen, follow social distancing and hygiene practices, wear masks and gloves and regular temperature checks. To reassure customers, they are attaching a note informing them about the chef and delivery agent’s body temperatures along with a set of instructions to follow before consuming the food.“We had been thinking about it, but wanted to take our time to do the backend work. I don’t think restaurants and pubs are coming back to life anytime soon with the norms that would have to be followed. So while the demand for eating is not going away, where the consumption happens is set to change, and this is our way to adapt,” said Sameer Seth, partner at Hunger Inc Hospitality that runs the two restaurants. On day one, the restaurants, working out of their kitchen in Bandra Kurla Complex delivered orders from Colaba to Navi Mumbai. To keep the excitement going, the restaurant plans to change the menu every two weeks and also introduce specials for the weekend.Chef Gresham Fernandes, Culinary Director, Impresario Handmade Restaurants said that several of the brand’s restaurants including Salt Water Cafe, Smoke House Deli, Ishaara, Flea Bazaar Cafe, SOCIAL select outlets and anti SOCIAL were delivering. Fernandes said that multiple reasons—calls from regular guests for comfort food, the need to pay rent and salaries of employees and even supporting their suppliers—led to the decision to resume operations. “ We are running the kitchen at Salt Water Cafe with just five people. They stay here at the restaurant and are provided with meals and a bed. This ensures that they are safe too,” Fernandes said.Smoke House Deli, Pali Hill is also delivering DIY kits—a range of packages filled with ingredients and recipes of the restaurant—that patrons can cook at home. The company said this is a great way for parents to cook with children or couples who wanted to do something special on date nights. “Another great insight we got that it is like sanitising the food yourself. This reassures the patrons too,” a spokesperson said.The fear still looms large for many. Bandra-based mother to a six-month-old infant, Rita Jagtiani said that while the idea to have someone else cook may otherwise seem tempting, in the current situation, it was daunting. “I won’t be ordering anytime soon. I am happy eating something simple at home. We are trying to limit the number of people coming home. Irrespective of the measures taken by the restaurants, the same delivery person will be going to several homes. Why would I also want the extra pressure of cleaning the bags or handling the boxes a certain way? The fear is always going to be there. Cooking at home definitely involves a lot of work, but I just want to be safe,” she said.Restaurateurs, however, are taking each day as it comes. Saransh Goila of Goila’s Butter Chicken said, “We are seeing only about 30% of our regular volumes and if this continues it might not be worth continuing operations and putting our staff at risk. But, we also find comfort in being able to serve those who cannot cook.”",Mumbai restaurants cook up new ideas to keep pot boiling,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75338371,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1262696,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/restaurants-cook-up-new-ideas-to-keep-pot-boiling/articleshow/75335452.cms

But perhaps he had one of his most meaningful performances recently when he and his two sons held a concert for their neighbours from the balcony of their home in west Delhi’s Rajouri Garden.“Since I am a former member of the band Euphoria, the crowd was excited, particularly because I was singing ‘Maeri’, one of the band’s top hits,” said Madan. He was accompanied by son Ariv (12) on the guitar and Advay (11) on the drums. Keeping the stircrazy audience in mind, the trio presented songs ranging from Punjabi folk to Indipop.“A lot of people thanked us for making them feel less lonely and we have held such concerts twice,” Madan said. They plan to continue with their effort at entertaining their house-bound neighbours till the lockdown is lifted. The kids are both exhilarated, the balcony concerts being their “most attended” stage performances till date.The novel coronavirus has moved performances from thronging halls to tiny balconies from Madrid to Mumbai and from Toronto to Zhejiang. Balconies offer a structural distancing of the musicians and the members of their audiences. For the performers, their cramped balconies with space for just a set of drums and some amps have taken on dimensions that are measured in happiness rather than square feet.Rahul Sharma, a guitarist-cum-singer from B Block of Swasthya Vihar in east Delhi, said he first performed on March 22 when the janata curfew closed India down for a day. ""When everyone came to their balconies to beat utensils as per the Prime Minister’s request, I saw a wave of happiness ripple across the neighbourhood and realised that little things done with a common purpose can light up everyone’s mood,"" Sharma said. ""I immediately posted a message on the RWA group informing them about a small gig I’d like to organise on the balcony. It proved a hit and I have performed two more times since.""In Indirapuram’s Ashiana Greens, Captain Ranbir, the RWA president, accepted music’s capacity to light up people’s mood. ""When the lockdown was announced, I had this idea of performing for the people in my colony to make things less gloomy. It’s been almost a fortnight that we have been performing every day,"" Ranbir said brightly. ""The neighbours get their cups of tea to the balconies, recline and cheer along as we sing. We sing Bollywood classics because both the young and the old enjoy such songs.""Ranbir said it was sad that it took a pandemic to bring all the residents together, but now everyone is glad that they are together ensuring their spirits are kept high despite being confined to homes.Jaideep Singh of E Block, Kalkaji, claimed to have performed for a cumulative 50 hours in his colony. ""Some days are Sufi nights, some are Bollywood nights, while others are ghazal and retro nights,"" Singh said. ""We have also celebrated six birthdays in this period. Besides, every evening from 5.30pm to 6pm, all of us gather in the balconies and pray.""Singh said everyone looked forward to these events, and he is happy about doing his bit to bring down the barriers among many residents who had never interacted with each other earlier.For many musicians, the balcony concerts were also an opportunity to increase their audiences. They and their neighbours have posted videos of the performances online to be shared thousands of times. When Madan played his first quarantine gig in March, an estimated 20,000 people joined live via Facebook across the world. ""Our neighbours were engaging with us through social media and within no time we saw our performance going viral,"" he said.Meanwhile, several artists are organising online ""watch parties"" too. DJ Priyansh Dhaka said that his neighbours and friends all know when he would be performing and, like him, in lockdown but performing all the same, they join him virtually from their homes. He revealed that he recently organised an online event expecting a maximum of 500 viewers to see him play live, but belying expectations, the watch party was attended by over 1,500 viewers. ""Since I have an audience of my own, I am encouraging other artists to contribute and play for my audience. This will eventually be good for their reach,"" Dhaka said.","Balcony concerts help locked-down Delhiites beat boredom, get to know their neighbours","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75309684,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1215617,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/balcony-concerts-help-locked-down-delhiites-beat-boredom-get-to-know-their-neighbours/articleshow/75309653.cms

This year, too, we would help students from Coimbatore and Pollachi,” she said.After the pandemic broke out, she decided to donate money to the CM’s fund to buy protective gear for frontline workers. “It’s sad to see people stepping out even when a lockdown is in place. If people follow lockdown guidelines and stay at home, the spread can be controlled,” she said.While Palaniammal wants to protect the Covid-19 warriors from the outside, social worker A Shanmugam of Erode, is worried about the inner wellbeing of people. He has distributed more than 9,000 packets of ‘kabasura kudineer’ in the district. Most poor people don’t know about it. Even if they do, they don’t have the money, he said. “I was procuring them from medical stores. Each herbal packet cost me Rs 140,” said the man who travels 12km every day to hand it over to the poor.But after health officials, who heard about his service, advised him to get it from the government siddha hospitals and clinics, the social worker has been getting them in bulk packs and repacking them into smaller ones of six-grams each.On Tuesday in Dindigul, meanwhile, 86-year-old retired teacher Ramamoorthy walked 5km from his residence in Nagal Nagar to the Dindigul collectorate to hand over his pension of Rs 26,378 to the CM’s fund.

Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik did the unthinkable and vested sarpanches in gram panchayats with powers of district collectors to fight Covid . In Kerala, its network of local bodies and women empowerment programme, Kudumbashree, took the state’s battle against the virus to the community level. Tamil Nadu ’s local body heroes, however, were missing in action.The state’s newly-elected councillors of rural local bodies appear to have either stepped back from the Covid arena or were kept back by the district administration. With 28 of the 37 districts identified as hotspots in Tamil Nadu, the struggle has been intense to screen, test and contain potential Covid positive cases. The local body councillors could have been an important cog in the wheel in creating awareness among the public on staying indoors, social distancing and helping the district administrations in throwing a security cordon around containment zones.The timely elections to urban local bodies could have provided the government foot soldiers at the ward level, rather than leave all the work to overworked health teams. It is the politics of governance that’s proved a deterrent for the collectors. ""Every district has an equal or more number of DMK supporters who are representatives in local bodies. It would have been difficult to handle the politics if we had roped them in,"" admitted a collector, seeking anonymity.In villages, panchayat heads are trying hard to make their presence felt. Chairwoman of the Chekkanoorani panchayat union in Madurai Kavitha Raja said they were doing their bit in creating awareness. ""We have distributed masks and sanitizers to the people, especially sanitary workers, to protect them. But the local bodies are facing a cash crunch and most of the activities are being done with our own funds,"" said Kavitha Raja. Some say they had spent their cash reserves on the elections and are now stressed for funds.The elected representatives say some of them are doing their might to be in the good books of the local ruling party leaders. ""From distributing pamphlets and educating the public to stay at home and maintain social distancing, we have scaled up our efforts after our village was declared a red zone,"" said commerce graduate R Subhadra, 31, a first-time village president of Kakkalur panchayat near Thiruvallur. She created WhatsApp groups to ensure door delivery of provisions and employed vehicles to sell vegetables at doorsteps.In the case of Tiruvannamalai district, enthusiastic village panchayat chiefs are doing their best in supporting the state’s efforts. But, some see it as a photo op. ""Our district collector had admonished a few of them, who had not paid salaries on time to sweepers earlier in their panchayats. He has permitted people’s representatives to coordinate efforts, but insisted they don’t attract crowds,"" said an executive officer of a panchayat union.In Ariyalur’s Unjini panchayat, the elected representatives barricaded the village borders to prevent outsiders from entering their village. P Kannan, the panchayat’s vice-president said they had sprayed a natural disinfectant solution made from a mixture of neem leaves paste and turmeric water in public places.But paucity of funds has indeed driven the elected representatives of local bodies indoors. ""Unlike the urban local bodies, adequate funds are not available to us to roll out preventive measures,"" said P Kannan, vice-president of Unjini panchayat, Ariyalur district. The proactive measures taken up by his panchayat through his own spending, such as spraying natural disinfectants and distributing free face masks to the villagers, were not appreciated by the officials thus far, he said. ""Perhaps, the officials in the district could have invited us for a meeting to discuss how we could contribute to check the Covid-19 spread in hamlets. We are tech-savvy. Video calls from our villages would have facilitated healthy discussions on preventive measures,"" said Kannan. Spraying a natural disinfectant made of turmeric and neem, and distributing Kabasura Kudineer may not kill the virus but such activities induce confidence and give hope to villagers, he said.In Coimbatore too, local representatives felt left out. ""At the rural level, we could have been involved in a better way in the containment efforts,"" said a panchayat president from the region.Their presence could have made a crucial difference.

Some of the outstanding works in street art have come from anonymous artists who conveyed strong messages, often with a generous dose of irreverence.
But none of them was hired by a government to paint a pathogen.I never thought I would use that prefix to ‘press conferences’, ever.
Cameramen argue they don’t get the “right angle” if social distancing is maintained at these press meets.","CHENNAI: Despite the Sunday spike of 105 Covid-19 positive cases and one recorded death, Tamil Nadu appears to have been doing reasonably well in slowing down the spread of the virus. The political leadership has been less opaque than it used to be (though it continues to hold back numbers to be ‘distributed’ across days), the bureaucracy has been working harder than usual and health workers continue to be the frontline warriors. On the whole, everyone has been doing more. There are, however, a few things we can do without. Here are my three picks.Talented artists including a few from Kollywood have been painting the novel coronavirus in brilliant reds and fluorescent greens. Street art for a cause sounds good, but those pictures of spherical monsters with protrusions don’t help alleviate the grim mood. And if the idea is to scare people to stay indoors, it doesn’t work. The corona faces are either comical or plain ugly, never scary. Instead, the artists could do some graffiti reflecting unity, resilience and hope.Street art is believed to have originated in the 1920s when the gangs of New York went on painting boxcars of trains with vivid messages. It spread across the world as a philosophy, a cult. Chris Daze, Dondi White and Lady Pink are some of those street artists who left indelible marks, literally, on the canvas called Earth. Some of the outstanding works in street art have come from anonymous artists who conveyed strong messages, often with a generous dose of irreverence. But none of them was hired by a government to paint a pathogen.I never thought I would use that prefix to ‘press conferences’, ever. But then, who thought we would be in lockdown for more than a month! After doctors and policemen, now two reporters in Chennai have been infected by the virus. This wouldn’t be a surprise for anyone who has seen how the Tamil Nadu health department press conferences are conducted.The same journalists who write and speak about social distancing refuse to walk the talk, and jostle for bytes from the health minister and officials. Cameramen argue they don’t get the “right angle” if social distancing is maintained at these press meets. The health minister should ban physical press conferences and brief the media via videoconference, as social distancing is as crucial as transparency and information in the fight against the virus.Working from home is a tough proposition for those who aren’t used to it (I can vouch for this). Changing the way we work isn’t easy, but the virus has taught us it is possible if we make an earnest effort. It’s a particularly tough time for politicians who enjoy mudslinging, but please resist the temptation. Dissent and criticism are inevitable for a healthy democracy, but most of our politicians consider faulting their rivals the oxygen of their profession.As much as citizens, politicians should point out the government’s mistakes, but this is also the time to rally behind the government for a united battle against the contagion. Never stop asking those relevant, uncomfortable questions when the establishment tries to hide or distort facts, but also contribute ideas and resources that would reinforce the state’s efforts to handle this emergency. If a global pandemic can’t unite us, nothing else will. For its part, the government should adopt an inclusive way of working, taking all parties along. Let’s forget the colour of our flags, for the final banner that flutters over our victory procession should read: Humanity won.","In this war against corona, three things we can do without","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75249707,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-144907,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/in-this-war-against-corona-three-things-we-can-do-without/articleshow/75249658.cms

But while interest in little kitchen adventures has soared — recipes feature among most popular Google searches in India — pantries have limited stocks.So, how do you make your mealtimes interesting during a lockdown? Two young female chefs in Bengaluru, who have made a mark in an industry dominated by men, say you don’t require several ingredients to make something that’s healthy, enjoyable and fit for an Instagram story. So, maybe stop hunting for artichokes and buy the basics wisely. (See box for recommendations and recipes.)Pastry chef Sanjana Fernando , 26, says ever since the lockdown began, she has been flooded with calls from friends and relatives with a sweet tooth. “The first thing I ask is: ‘Tell me what do you have in your pantry’,” she says, adding refined flour, sugar, butter and baking powder and soda are obvious picks for preparing desserts.Jasmine Kokal, junior souschef at Kebabs & Kurries, ITC Gardenia, says given the circumstances, there should be greater focus on nutrition while buying provisions. “Consider lentils and pulses for salads, stews and fritters. Sprouted pulses elevate the nutritional value, boost blood circulation and aid in digestion. These are must-have ingredients,” she says.Both Jasmine and Sanjana overcame a number of challenges to break onto the culinary scene. Sanjana studied culinary arts at Welcomgroup Graduate School of Hotel Administration, Manipal, and trained at ITC Windsor, later working as a souschef at an artisanal coffee chain in Bengaluru. She was inspired by her mother, British food writer and chef Nigella Lawson and French culinary star Raymond Blanc. “At the age of 16, I started baking my own birthday cake. I studied political science at Delhi University , but I knew my calling was in baking,” she says. Her Instagram page, @i.knead.loaf, showcases her various creations, from cookies, ice-creams and hot buns to pies and cakes.Jasmine, 25, leans more towards savoury Indian flavours. “My mother was born in Kerala, while my father is a Sindhi. And I grew up in Mumbai. I was exposed a unique confluence of cultures, which drove my interest in cooking,” she says.She did her postgraduation in hotel management at the Indian Institute of Hospitality and Management, Mumbai. Her fondest memories are from trips to Kerala, where she learned how to light a fire with coconut coir: “I used to love the fragrant cooking techniques at my grandmother’s home.”Jasmine’s cooking combines the best of north and south.Both chefs received support from their families, but establishing a name as professionals was tough. “Though cooking in a household is still considered a woman’s duty, kitchens in the hospitality industry are dominated by men,” she says. But she found good mentors who taught her to be firm in her dealings.Jasmine says there are challenges in every field and it depends on the kind of people you work with. “When I discussed my interest in the food industry with my family, we didn’t know anyone in the field and the general opinion was that the work pressure and load would be high. But such hurdles should not scare you if you want to make it big,” she says, adding more young women should consider a career in the industry.",'More from less': How chefs plan cooking in quarantine,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75247086,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-158271,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/more-from-less-how-chefs-plan-cooking-in-quarantine/articleshow/75246917.cms

The patient also expressed his fears about depression , having to staying indoors disconnected from his peers, who otherwise he met every day.For elderly people, the Covid lockdown has given rise to social, economic and emotional challenges in addition to their health issues. The problem is bigger for the aged poor. Recognising these concerns, Dr Chatterjee , founder of voluntary organisation Healthy Aging India, has been in contact with around 1,000 seniors living in old-age homes in and around Delhi, providing medical assistance and nutritious meals. The NGO is also assisting the poor in the slums of Rohini, Prem Nagar, Jahangirpuri and Vasant Kunj.To drive home the point that the elderly needed more attention and care in the current situation, Chatterjee shared the preliminary findings of an ongoing study of 131 inmates of old-age homes. The study found 60% of those surveyed requiring evaluation to establish if they were suffering from depression. Cognitive impairment was observed in over 46% of the respondents. A significant number also had co-morbidities like hypertension, COPD and diabetes. Chatterjee reiterated that these medical conditions increased the vulnerability of the elderly to Covid-19.“Healthy Aging India has been reaching out to 27 old-age homes in Delhi and NCR for some years. After the lockdown came into effect, we heard from old-age homes dependents how they often ran out of food,” said Chatterjee. “So, we decided to focus not just on health, but also nutrition. In 10 homes, we provided food because they had none.”Chatterjee gets time after his duties at AIIMS to be with his volunteers in making one complete meal available to the needy elderly to help them weather the crisis. “We had never worked with food, but the need was such that we could not ignore it,” Chatterjee admitted. “Good Samaritans came forward to support us. We have set up a kitchen at a community centre in Vasant Kunj with permission from the district authorities to prepare the daily meals daily, observing, of course, social distancing norms.”What began as an experiment has grown into a daily operation of providing 3,000 to 4,000 meals each day to those in need. Even though the anti-coronavirus protocols, like using masks and gloves and maintaining distancing, are followed, the Healthy Aging teams plans to provide dry rations during the second phase of the lockdown till May 3 to minimise contact and so protect the old people and themselves from infection.On the challenges of the inmates of old-age homes, Chatterjee noted, “Most of them have little interest in the life outside as they feel abandoned and lonely, living as they are away from their children and families. During the lockdown, it became essential to focus on their physical and mental health even more. That they are living in a closed facility helps to protect them from infection. Our medical teams don’t go into the homes. Instead those who are sick come out, and we examine them for illness and provide medicines. The focus is on building awareness.”","When age-old woes of hunger, depression weigh more than Covid","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75242529,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-153655,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/when-age-old-woes-of-hunger-depression-weigh-more-than-covid/articleshow/75240368.cms

The answer may be gourmet delivery services started by chefs and restaurateurs who want to utilise existing capacities and create at least some revenue to pay staff wages while giving diners the option to order food created by top talent.In Mumbai, chef Prateek Sadhu and restaurateur Adit Dugar , whose restaurant Masque had been awarded Asia’s 50 Best One to Watch, have announced that the restaurant’s kitchen will be open soon for takeaways and deliveries. “I am planning to do Kashmiri food… these are very tough times. We paid our staff for March but now we have to do something to continue,” says chef Sadhu.Chef-led food delivery services had started appearing in the metros even before Covid, but now they’re hoping to tap into a market that is looking for more than the food churned out by ubiquitous cloud kitchens.Iktara, a new food delivery started by The Table’s Gauri Devidayal and Jay Yousuf in collaboration with chef Amninder Sandhu in February is operational in south Mumbai with a menu that mixes comfort and exotica. Dishes like kulche, beetroot tikki, murgh malai tikka and Sandhu Saab’s chicken (the chef’s special white chicken butter masala) are on the menu alongside more unusual dishes like gosht ka halwa, Sandhu’s take on a courtly recipe (minced meat is boiled in salt water, fried in ghee with khoya and scented with cardamom, rose water, saffron to create the exotic dish). The menu is available on Scootsy, Zomato and Swiggy.In Delhi, chef Mohammed Ahsan Ali Qureshi, son of the legendary Imtiaz Qureshi, has teamed up with three childhood friends (with backgrounds in marketing, finance and investment banking) to launch Cross Border Kitchens, a “multi-brand internet-driven food and beverage company,” as he calls it. Of the seven delivery brands the company owns, one is dubbed Irfan Bhai, offering Lucknawi food the Qureshi family is synonymous with — from paya-nahari to makhmali (velvety) qorma. Another, called Biryani Central, ups the ante with dum cooking.Caterer and restaurateur Varun Tuli, whose delivery brand Noshi delivers dim sum, sushi, quinoa bowl meals, wok and curry meals in Delhi’s Greater Kailash Part 1 and Gurgaon, says there is an added focus on hygiene. “Our kitchens are large and open, food is packaged in multiple layers and not handled by anyone other than the chef. All delivery staff we hire have their own vehicles. All these are important factors for customers today, seeking assurance about hygiene and safety,” Tuli says.How customers in the metros respond to these remains to be seen but entrepreneur Karan Tanna, founder of Ghost Kitchens, is confident that high-quality deliveries are the way to go. “Food tech aggregators were losing money in the past because the cost of delivery was higher than the average cheque per meal in the delivery space. Now, that may change,” feels Tanna. If that happens, it might be a taste for what the future holds.","With restaurants closed, fine dining comes home","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75160598,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-174196,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/with-restaurants-closed-fine-dining-comes-home/articleshow/75150539.cms

Jessie Kaur says, “The Kaur Project is an identity project that has created a space for Sikh women to be heard and seen.
An interesting aspect of her experience is the difference in the way Sikh women from India and converts such as herself are sometimes treated.","Growing up in New Jersey as the daughter of a Kirtaniya father, Gurpreet Kaur grew up in a house where kirtan was a big part of life. “He taught my sister, brother and I and never discriminated in terms of what instruments we learnt,” says Kaur. “Once I got out of my sheltered life is when I realized that the world doesn’t operate that way.”While the Guru Granth Sahib affirms equality between the genders, there is still a gap when it comes to women having access to participating in religious rituals. Despite the Punjab Assembly ’s resolution allowing women to perform kirtan seva at the Golden Temple in November 2019, there has been no progress in actually enabling women to perform at the gurudwara, since the decision lies in the hands of the SGPC. Still, things are starting to change -- Sikh women living in other countries have been making moves that enable women to be central parts of religious ceremony, whether that means all-female groups performing kirtan or setting up events and camps to encourage women to get involved in administrative and leadership positions at the Gurudwara.Gurpreet Kaur has spent the last few holding gender empowerment workshops in Sikh student associations in colleges across the US, Canada and the UK and working with young mothers to discuss the importance of equality within the household. “For the last five years, there has been a movement called ‘I am Kaur’. It’s about figuring out how we can continue dialogues about gender within the religion. I have a daughter and I want her to be able to see me on stage at the Gurudwara so she knows she can do it as well.” After her two young kids go off to college, her dream is to continue her fight for equality by becoming one of the first female granthis.Asha Marie Kaur, a researcher at the Sikh Research institute, which holds educational retreats about Sikhi for young adults, says that she has seen things change in the US in her lifetime. She says, “The next generation of women is slowly taking over when it comes to educational programming. Growing up, I did see women do kirtan and making langar food, but seeing women read from the Guru Granth Sahib was far less common.” Part of the problem, she adds, is stigma related to menstruation. “It’s strange because Guru Nanak spoke specifically on the issue of menstrual purity. I have studied that particular shlok and done a translation, and he said the notion of purity is a complete falsehood.” She compares the Punjab Assembly’s resolution to the UN condemning Israel’s occupation of Palestine – it makes their position clear, but can’t compel implementation.United Sikhs is an international NGO that works in 12 countries on education, empowerment, and providing humanitarian aid with the help of their volunteer base that runs into the thousands. Sun Kaur, their London-based director, says, “Guru Nanak Sahib ji raised the position of women in society at a time when the prevailing Manu tradition considered women paer di jutti (shoes on someone's feet). Guru Gobind Singh Ji formalised it when he created the genderless Khalsa . Today, we see women of our faith lead in society, forefront humanitarian projects, sit with political leaders and help shape the world.” One such woman is her colleague Mejinderpal Kaur who in 2003 was prevented from participating in the Sukh-aasan ritual at Harmandir Sahib . Sukh-aasan is a late night ritual where the Guru Granth Sahib is shifted from the sanctum sanctorum to the Akal Takht precincts. Sun Kaur says hearing about this experience made her “understand that at times a woman still needs to battle for her rights and there are many reasons for this such as lack of education, the patriarchal society we live in and perhaps not practically applying the message of Guru Nanak Sahib ji.”The organisation holds 'Kaur camps', enabling Sikh women to get together, network and empower each other to work for the betterment of their community. Seeing women in the UK being general secretaries and even the president of a Gurudwara has been a huge source of inspiration, she adds. Women are also very involved in their various humanitarian projects, most recently providing aid for the Australian bushfires.Historically speaking, women have had successful careers as Kirtaniye, according to Gurminder Kaur Bhogal, Catherine Mills Davis Chair in Music at Wellesley College who has done research on female voices in kirtan as a musical tradition. In a published article, she examined the different ways kirtan has developed since the days of kirtaniye like Bibi Jaswinder Kaur and Surinder Kaur whose early 20th century recordings Bhogal studied at the All India Radio archives (Delhi) and in the private collection of Boston-based Sikh scholar, Sarbpreet Singh: “Social and gender equality are central hence the notable presence of female kirtaniye within Gurmat Sangeet communities: no longer glued to the harmonium, women are encouraged to learn instruments based on those of the past, thus their disciplined bodies move with a modest grace as they draw a bow across the sarangi or dilruba, as they pluck the strings of the saranda and rabab.” In Boston where she lives, she says many younger women are taking an interest in learning not only traditional instruments, but also the tabla. “I can see more women who are involved in leadership, decision making, and in the running of the gurudwara, in addition to langar seva. There’s usually a Khalsa school which is associated with the gurudwara where kids go to learn about sikhi and kirtan. A lot of the women are also teachers and leaders there; they help children learn about Sikh history and culture.” She adds that another new phenomenon is the slow rise of mixed gender kirtan groups, which she is beginning to see more and more of.The reason that change is perhaps occurring at a faster rate in diaspora communities, she says, is that the community is far smaller than in Delhi, for instance. “There’s a community which enables women to think that maybe they can say something and they will be heard,” she says, urging young women to be unafraid of speaking up. “This is their community and gurudwara as much as it is anyone else’s.”Another initiative aimed towards Sikh women is the Kaur Project, which collects the stories of Sikh women and is the brainchild of Vancouver-based storyteller and founder Jessie Kaur . Jessie Kaur says, “The Kaur Project is an identity project that has created a space for Sikh women to be heard and seen. The project started with storytelling and photography of Kaurs unpacking their journeys.” They are currently in the midst of expanding the scope of the project, creating self-discovery workshops and meditation tools. Sukhvinder Kaur Vinning, their spiritual lead, says, “There are a handful of Gurdwaras in Vancouver’s suburbs who are actively creating spaces for female youth to learn and lead the Hukumnama, Ardaas, Sahajpaath, Akandpaath and Parshaad seva.”Vinning argues that the faith being affected by colonialism is partly the cause of the current situation. “We went from being a householder’s faith to one that needed priests to do Parchaar and Gurdwaras to mimic churches, from having the equivalent of female bishops in the 1500s, to most women not being allowed to do anything with Sikh Parchaar under the British.”Charanjit Kaur is an academic who co-wrote a paper on the role of Sikh women in religious practice in Malaysia. She says women play a significant role in the religion, singing kirtan, teaching Punjabi and some contributing in religious discourse (gurbani veechar) as well as the opening and closing sessions of the scripture. She says that she even knows of a few female granthis in the country. However, she adds that female representation in Gurudwara Management Committees in Malaysia is still uncommon, and most tend to stick to religious organisations dedicated to women. This doesn’t mean that women in Malaysia have remained silent on issues. In the paper, she discussed a situation in the 1950s where a women’s group called Istri Milap Singapura held a special session to oppose the use of purdah by Sikh women, arguing that it was not in line with the philosophy of the Guru Granth Sahib. The practice unfortunately continued at Gurdwara Polis Ipoh, despite their protestations.While things are getting better, there is still a ways to go. A female granthi is still pretty much unheard of, and rituals like ‘chaur seva’ wherein one uses an implement called the chaur to fan the Granth are largely male-dominated. Women and girls “don’t get to do that most of the time,” Gurpreet Kaur noted. A unique aspect of religious ceremony in the West is the role of the convert community. Sangat Dhyan Kaur is a convert who visits both a Punjabi-Indian gurudwara as well as a one that converts tend to go to. An interesting aspect of her experience is the difference in the way Sikh women from India and converts such as herself are sometimes treated. “I have never seen women do Chaur Seva. But, when the Western sangat comes over to the Punjabi sangat, we occasionally get the change to sit behind the Guru Granth Sahib.” Once, she encouraged an Indian friend to do Chaur Seva but she said no, sounding somewhat scared at the prospect.

“When we deviate and go beyond the content, we may lose time, which is crucial in today’s movie making.","Slick creations rooted in realism or based on tales of dalit oppression from young, tech savvy directors have changed Tamil cinema beyond recognition. No longer do you get to watch films based on rural life, steeped in Tamil culture and dominated by grannies who sang, danced or fought their way into viewers’ hearts.Whether it was Paravai Munniyamma, whose recent passing signalled the end of an era, or Kollangudi Karuppayee, who was a regular fixture in the 1980s and the 1990s beginning with Pandiarajan’s ‘Aan Paavam’, these effervescent women, most of them folk artists, breathed life into every film they starred in — combining innocence, energy and naughtiness effortlessly. Karuppayee last came into the limelight in 2019 when her lament about not being able to cast her vote in the elections of the Nadigar Sangam, embroiled in legal tangles, grabbed public attention.There have been many who dallied with village-based themes, but it was probably P Bharathiraja who had the biggest role in highlighting these women - their behaviour, speech and attire in perfect sync. When Ganthimathi in Bharatiraja’s ‘Mann Vasanai’ (1983) uttered the non-lexical “ chithada kalli viragu odaika ponalam kathala mullu kothoda kuthidichan” (A lazy girl forced to chop firewood may complain she has been poked by a bunch of aloe vera thorns). The dedication with which directors introduced such characters made them last decades, their complex mix of honesty, brutality and ugliness taking the audience along.When offered a role opposite thespian Sivaji Ganesan in Bharathiraja’s 1985 flick ‘Muthal Mariyathai’, Vadivukkarasi, as she later mentioned, imagined her role would be akin to K R Vijaya ’s in ‘Thanga Pathakkam’ (1974). The role of ‘Ponnatha’ that she ultimately got, in her own words, was a rude shock, but the actor’s portrayal of the woman with elongated earlobes and unkempt habits remains unforgettable. Vadivukkarasi considers it one of her best ever.Filmmaker and writer Amshan Kumar wonders how folk artists or village-based themes can remain relevant when music itself is being slowly phased out, but believes this phase too shall pass. “For years, our movies depended on songs. There will be a time when scripts reinvent themselves and the grand old ladies will get back their rightful place. How can one forget the contribution of K B Sundarambal? An acceptable format to cater to mainstream audience imbibing our culture is bound to happen when the transition takes place,” he says.Kumar, who won a national award for his documentary ‘Yazhpanan Thedchanamoorthy’, says caste-based scripts are presently ruling Kollywood, but cautions that no medium can survive on a single topic. The need to adopt old formulas mixed with modern ideas is imperative for art to survive, he adds. “I must say this period is a lull for the grand old ladies but there will be opportunities spread across various spectrums.”Patience of the audience is limited, says Blue Ocean Film and Television Academy (BOFTA) dean G Dhananjayan. “When movies are sometimes made with just four characters, how do we create such characters? Often, movies do not run for more than two-and-a-half hours. That gives directors little imaginative quotient, making them go for water-tight scripts.” But there is hope, he adds, pointing to actor Keerthy Suresh ’s grandmother Saroja whose roles in movies are still talked about.It was with trepidation that director Dharani introduced Paravai Munniyama in his ‘Dhool’ (2003), not sure if she would fit the bill. The performance she came up with worked wonders for the films as well as Munniyama, who was a big draw for her singing skills in stage programmes.Munniyama and Karuppayee, says T Dharmaraj, head of the folklore department at Madurai Kamaraj University , were symbols of rural talent in an urban setup. “They were romanticised by directors and that gelled well with the script. With the advent of television, the grand old ladies have taken a beating. The need for such characters has dwindled and the landscape too has changed. Villages are not so remote. So it is quite unlikely that we can revive such characters in today’s context.”Dhananjayan says the fun part of story-telling seems to have gone. “When we deviate and go beyond the content, we may lose time, which is crucial in today’s movie making.

The analysis claimed these levels were unprecedented and have not been since theAir Quality Index (AQI) was launched in 2014.Moreover, New Delhi recorded its best ever AQI of 45 on March 26 which was the first ‘good’ air qualityday in the capital since August 18 last year and only the third in more than three years.Analysis of System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) data brought to the forethat the near-complete stoppage of daily traffic has led to drastic fall in the levels of particulate matter (PM)2.5. The pollutant’s levels dropped by 62% in Delhi, 45% in Mumbai, 31% in Pune and 57% in Ahmedabadpost April 6.However, the biggest impact has been on the levels nitrogen dioxide which is formed from the burning ofcoal and vehicular emissions. The high presence of pollutant can increase the risk of respiratory ailments. “InPune, NOx pollution has reduced by 62% in the week starting April 6, in Mumbai by 60%, in Delhi by 50%and in Ahmedabad by 32%,” the analysis stated.It further highlighted that in 38 monitoring stations in Delhi, NOx levels dropped drastically, except inJehangirpuri which recorded highest NOx levels in the capital at an avg of 77.63 on the third day of thelockdown, indicating the pollutant’s other sources apart from vehicles.It’s not just the cities that are breathing easy but also industrial clusters in Gujarat like Vapi, Ankaleshwar andVatva have also reported cleaner air during the lockdown. Vapi, ranked as the most polluted industrial clusteron the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI),recorded a 79.7% drop in sulphur dioxide (SO2) levels, one of the key emissions from coal-fired thermalpower plants. “The air quality index in Vapi dropped to 100 from 313 on March 19,” the analysis added.Stating that a nationwide lockdown should not be needed to achieve improved air quality, the analysissuggested some mitigation measures for policy-makers. “Monitoring data proves that shut down of localsources from activities like transport, construction and industries have reduced PM2.5, PM10 and NOxlevels, but background pollution levels remain even amidst the complete halt to the economy.

Firecracker parties on rooftops. Or just sitting at home feeling time stand still and the walls closing in. The lockdown – a definite period bygovernment announcements, an indefinite and often times frustrating wait by mental standards -- is makingpeople either get in to the act or simply act out, say behavioural experts who are trying to make sense of whatis going inside the minds of people.The terminology of social distancing is wrong and can have a negative impact on behaviour, says professorSanjeev P Sahni of the Jindal Institute of Behavioural Science. “It conjures up an image of mental disconnect.What we are being asked to maintain is physical distancing. Social distancing can make one feel emotionallydistant.”Counsellor and behavioural expert, Manjushree Palit says the seemingly indefinite wait is going to bringabout an escalation of emotion. “Those who are negative will become more so. Relationships that are stressedwill worsen. Lack of trust will enhance,” says Palit. “Mental fatigue and anger are likely to be aggravated asthe waiting period gets longer. You are constantly reminded you are powerless no matter how much moneyyou have, how healthy you are or how young.”Waiting is not a pleasant thing, explains Palit. “We are not a people who like to follow rules. You cannotchange that behaviour overnight. The government has changed that behaviour to some extent because of thefear of the virus but if the date is extended people will get restless and there will be a time when some people-- mostly those who already had risk-taking behaviour -- just decide to break the quarantine.”Psychiatrist Dr Mohan Raj believes that for the first part of the lockdown people were in “vacation mode”.But now reality has struck, which can cause restlessness resulting in more people venturing out of theirhomes as days pass even though the lockdown is in force. To understand what was going on in their minds,Dr Mohan asked a couple of people in his apartment complex why they were going out for walks when therewas a quarantine, to which they replied “whoever is afraid can stay in the house, we just can’t anymore”.Quiet aggression is something one is going to see more of in the days of waiting, says Sahni. “While peoplekeep repeating that this lockdown period is a chance to spend quality time with the family, I don’t see it thatway. People are becoming irritable, frustrated and aggressive with the people they are supposedly the closestto. People are stuck in confined spaces and the only thing that has flown the nest is patience.”Increasing levels of loneliness and isolation may also drive people to break the quarantine protocol, saysPalit, which is why providing community-level support such as free counseling services is important. “Also,if one wants to induce a more positive behavioural change, one needs to disseminate information that aids it.Along with news on death rates, why not one on survival rates? News on the positive impact of the lockdownon climate change, or stories of altruism? All this can go a long way in helping people deal with thelockdown,” she says.",Covid-19: The waiting game and how it’s playing out in people’s minds,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75137434,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-153215,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/covid-19-the-waiting-game-and-how-its-playing-out-in-peoples-minds/articleshow/75137434.cms

This aspect needs to be studied scientifically,” said Dr Niranjan Rai, an environmental activist.Rai said the government had overlooked the potential consequences of the Yettinahole project.
Still, various agencies have shown exaggerated rainfall data in the Yettinahole project area.","MANGALURU: About a month ago, trekkers in Anegundi forest wondered if they had lost their way because the topography appeared to have changed. In place of the Mrityunjaya river, a tributary of the Nethravathi, was a mess of debris, boulders and logs. They returned with photographs of the river that was, and a lurking fear that it never will be.Environmentalists say heavy rains and the landslide of 2019 may have caused a blockade, causing the river to change course. Hydrologists say rivers of the Western Ghats do go dry in summer, beginning March; and are known to change direction as the slopes are washed down during heavy rains and block the course of the river. Activists, on the other hand, argue that the “natural” phenomena are increasingly becoming man-made, exacerbated by unscientific developmental projects, illegal construction and encroachments.Mrityunjaya is one of the nine tributaries of the Nethravathi, a west-flowing river that joins the sea in Mangaluru. It originates at Madugundi in Chikkamagaluru district, about 120km from Mangaluru, and joins the Nethravathi near Gadayikallu in Belthangadi taluk of Dakshina Kannada.“The heavy rains that led to hill collapse last year have destroyed the Mrityunjaya river,” said ecologist Dinesh Holla, who led the trekking team to Anegundi on March 15, stressing that increased human activity and encroachments in the ecologically fragile regions of the Western Ghats were the major reasons behind natural disasters.“The river path is now filled with huge boulders and logs. We were shocked to see the place where the Mrityunjaya river used to flow once. By the look of it, one can’t tell if there ever was a river, or if it will get back to life in the rainy season,” he said.Besides landslides, construction is wreaking havoc in the Ghats, he said. Homestays, resorts and estates in Madugundi, Durgadahalli, Sunkasale, Malemane, Kelagooru, Megooru, Javala and Balooru have been built by encroaching on forest land, he said. “These encroachers not only construct buildings, they also clear the land, lopping trees and hillsides. These are all triggers for natural disasters.”A hydel project – Trinetra -- constructed across the river too has been destroyed. “Damaged dam structures are scattered in the area. This leads to fears about the ongoing Yettinahole project wherein the government is constructing seven dams in the ecologically fragile regions of the Ghats,” he said. The Yettinahole project involves transferring water of the Nethravathi, through six dams, to meet the drinking water needs of Chikkaballapur, Tumakuru, Ramanagara, Kolar and Bengaluru Rural, among others. It has been in the works for six years now and involves substantial diversion of forest land.“Almost all rivers originating in the Western Ghats remain dry in March. When steep hills and slopes collapse during rains, the river’s path gets blocked and it will change its course of flow,” said SG Mayya, former professor of Water Resources Engineering at National Institute of Technology – Karnataka , Surathkal.“For this reason, we have been trying to convince the government that there will be no water to lift from Yettinahole project. Though these tributaries join Nethravathi, we cannot prejudge the changes that will happen in summer.”“It is a known fact that seismic activities increase due to construction of dams. Increased human interference in the forest may have triggered the natural disaster in the region where Mrityunjaya river was flowing. This aspect needs to be studied scientifically,” said Dr Niranjan Rai, an environmental activist.Rai said the government had overlooked the potential consequences of the Yettinahole project. “The government has not conducted an environmental impact assessment properly before launching the project. They have not studied the social impact either or factored in reports by experts. The government is to blame for all the natural disasters we are facing,” he said.Mayya added, “The tributaries feed Nethravathi only in the rainy season. Even the Nethravathi bed remains dry during many stretches in summer. Still, various agencies have shown exaggerated rainfall data in the Yettinahole project area.

Mobilising their mite under the banner VANI (Voluntary Action Network India), they have set out to manufacture khadi masks and sanitizers, employing villagers and tribals in their area.While khadi symbolizes national pride and patriotism, doubts have been raised if the porous material would prove an effective shield against the virus. “In fact, people must use only masks made of cloth. Using khadi is not a problem,” said said Dr Devi Shetty chairman of Narayana Health .

In India, however, the practice of covering the face with a cloth is an age-old one, dictated by the subcontinent’s tropical weather.
“For instance, while going to the fields for ablutions, it kept odours, flies and dirt away.

New York-based designer Naeem Khan , who counts Michelle Obama and Kate Middleton as clients, is one of them.","Both US and Indian health officials have recommended that people wear “non-medical cloth masks” to prevent the spread of Covid-19. But it won’t be an exaggeration to say that right now the world is divided into two kinds of people — those who wear masks in public, and those who doubt its efficacy. In India, however, the practice of covering the face with a cloth is an age-old one, dictated by the subcontinent’s tropical weather. Textile expert and veteran designer Ritu Kumar points out that Indians have always worn three-piece costumes — an upper, lower and a head garment that functioned as a face mask.“In Maharashtra’s Karle caves, which date back to the second century BC, there are drawings of male and female figures dressed in these three pieces.” In fact, the practice continues with urban women using their dupattas to fashion a mask that protects them from heat and pollution while the former use their odhnis when they go outdoors. “For instance, while going to the fields for ablutions, it kept odours, flies and dirt away. It’s similar to how women in Japan used fans,” says Kumar.Men too used the ends of their turban and shoulder cloth or gamcha as cover for face when outdoors. Swasti Singh Ghai, discipline lead, textile design, National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad, says the practice of carrying a cloth as a face mask was especially prevalent in agricultural communities of the hot, humid and dusty north.“In the Kutch district of Gujarat, it was common to see traders carrying a shoulder cloth for this purpose. It would also double up as a bag to carry knick-knacks,” says Ghai. Textile revivalist and costume designer Sandhya Raman says early Sanskrit literature has a wide vocabulary of terms for the veils and scarfs used by women during the ancient period, such as avagunthana meaning cloak-veil, uttariya meaning shoulderveil, mukha-pata meaning face-veil, siro-vastra meaning head-veil. “The dupatta is believed to have evolved from the ancient uttariya. We have the hijab and purdah in some communities. The modern versions are stoles and scarves which young women sport,” says Raman, who also co-founded Desmania Designs.Raman adds that washing hands and feet before entering the house or consuming food also originated from the need to disinfect. “It’s a very old practice to keep the dust, infection or dirt out.”The face mask may have originated as a functional item but in recent times it has also become a fashion accessory. The trend started in China with models sporting Vogmasks on the ramp and spread to the West. At the Paris Fashion Week this February, guests attending the Chanel show came wearing special masks designed by the French luxury brand and bearing its iconic interlocked Cs logo. As Covid-19 spread, the mask ventured further from the first row to the ramp during French designer Marine Serre’s show that had models walking down in masks that at times covered the entire face except for the eyes. Although the collection was designed months earlier when the virus was just a lurking threat in Chinese wet markets, it now seems uncannily prescient.Now, a number of fashion houses and designers have started designing masks for frontline health workers who are facing shortage of protective gear. New York-based designer Naeem Khan , who counts Michelle Obama and Kate Middleton as clients, is one of them. In an Instagram post, Khan announced that he and his team have “started sewing CDC approved masks from medically approved fabrics…” Christian Siriano , and clothing brands Eileen Fisher and Rag and Bone have also started making masks.","#MaskIndia: Covering our faces is not an alien habit, it’s an ancient one","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75136985,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-150696,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/maskindia-covering-our-faces-is-not-an-alien-habit-its-an-ancient-one/articleshow/75136933.cms

But instead of intricately embroidered apparel and home furnishings for Okhai, a Kutch-based fashion brand, they are working to finish a batch of 4,000 masks. “Once they are ready we put them in pressure cookers and sterilise them,” says Kirti Poonia, Okhai head.Entrepreneurs, self-help groups, small businesses and some well-meaning individuals are trying their hand at the humble silai (sewing) machine to create what has become the accessory of our times: the mask. In fact, scientist Rashmi Sinha recently tweeted, “We need to normalise mask wearing” even advising people to use an app which adds a mask to their profile picture.A couple of weeks before the lockdown, former IITian Suhani Mehta realised that were no masks for her brother and sister-in-law, both of whom are doctors. “My brother works in a Navi Mumbai hospital and it had already run out of masks for them,” she says.Mohan and her business partner Kartik Mehta manufacture biodegradable sanitary pads under the label, Saral Design. The duo zeroed in on the design for a three-ply surgical mask by March 15, but before them lay a bigger challenge. “The lockdown had forced a lot of suppliers to shut down. We were unable to source material, so we started looking for options,” Mehta says. The couple succeeded in getting in touch with industrialist Anand Mahindra who offered to help. The team of 40 is making 3,000 masks a day and plans to ramp it up to 10,000 in the next 10 days.For many, it is a desire to make a difference, however small. In Jhansi, social worker Nitika Singh has been diligently stitching masks on her sewing machine to distribute them to people who can’t afford them. “I noticed how vegetable vendors, milk delivery people, and others were not wearing masks. So, I made 70 in two days and distributed them,” says Singh, who picked up the skill from YouTube tutorials. Ruchi, a Lucknow-based clothing business owner has made 300-350 masks for a local government hospital, after a doctor friend reached out asking if she could help. “We took printed cotton fabrics used for maternity robes to make these,” she says.Sixty-six year-old Prakash Solanki has let neither age nor ill-health get in the way of doing good work. A doctor and retired government employee, Rajkot-based Solanki and his wife have been stitching masks to give away to people working in the neighbourhood. “My father never forgot the tailoring skills that were taught to him as a young child. He suffers from Parkinson’s but for the few hours he can work, he stitches cloth masks,” says Khushboo Sharma, Solanki’s daughter. The couple make 30-40 masks a day and hand it out to vegetable sellers, garbage collectors or whoever else they feel needs it.Several designers are also pitching in by using their surplus waste fabric and karigars to make reusable and washable cloth masks. In Mumbai, fashion brand Karleo has partnered with Mumbai’s civic body, BMC, to supply masks free of charge under its project ‘Masks For Humanity’. Since March 28, the brand has been producing 1,000 masks every two days, which it supplies to BMC. “We have a model that involves very few people going out and minimum physical contact,” explains co-founder Leon Vaz. So scraps of cloth from Karleo’s wedding outfits are dropped off outside the homes of women, who then fashion them into masks and leave them outside for pick-up. These are then sanitised and ironed before delivery. Vaz adds that this also provides a livelihood to karigars who are now out of work. “ Lots of people are coming forward with donations of food and money, but few for masks. As designers, we already make accessories so this was the best way to contribute,” says Vaz. “ The idea is also to encourage other designers to be a part of this and get fabric donations.”In Kolkata, designer Abhishek Dutta has manufactured over 5,000 masks since March 20, which have been distributed to NGOs in the city for free and is working on another 5,000. “It is the need of the moment and my social responsbility as a designer,” says Dutta. His colourful masks are made with waste cloth, with non-woven fabrics being used for filtration, and cotton ribs being used as bands instead of elastic for comfort and durability.The Fashion Design Council of India has also sought permission from the state governments of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to produce masks, with designers such as Samat Chauhan, Rajesh Pratap Singh and Pawan Sachdeva volunteering use of their factories for this.“The masks produced by the designers will be protective masks, which will provide an extra layer of security and for many, at least one layer of security,"" says Sunil Sethi, Chairman FDCI. ""They will be distributing these masks free of cost.”Some see a business opportunity, given the lack of availability of masks. Delhi-based Anab Naiyar, who runs a handmade product brand on Etsy called Oony by Anab, started making her own masks in early March. “It became so difficult to buy one that I used an N95 mask at home as a template to make one and also embroidered it,” she says.

Doctors think so.The number of patients going to hospitals with heart attacks has come down across the country after the lockdown triggered by Covid-19 . Heart attack is the biggest killer in the country with more than three million recorded every year.“We normally see four or five patients with symptoms of cardiac diseases in a day. Now it has dropped to just two a day,” says Chennai-based cardiologist Dr Ajit Mullasari.The trend is visible even more clearly in the data collated by a consortium of state government hospitals. The state-run hospitals have recorded about 40% decline in the number of patients coming with complete blockage of heart blood vessels, technically called ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and up to 70% drop in patients coming with partial block, Non-ST elevation of myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Myocardial infarction is the technical term for heart attacks.On February 9, for instance, at least 33 STEMI and 22 N-STEMI cases were reported at various government hospitals across the state. It dropped to 20 STEMI and seven NSTEMI cases on April 2. While some experts attribute the dip to reduced pollution and trafficinduced stress, others say mild cases just don’t reach hospitals. “The reasons could also be lack of transport or fear of entering hospitals,” says Dr R Srikkanth, who heads the Tamil Nadu Accident and Emergency Initiative.“Most hospitals have cut down staff and outpatient services besides reducing elective surgeries to keep beds ready for Covid-19 patients,” he says. While doctors in Gujarat and Punjab have reported a 30% drop in heart attack cases, those in Delhi, Bengaluru and Mumbai have also registered less number of cases. This is in line with the dip in heart attack cases reported in the US, Italy and Germany.“I have never seen such small a number of patients in my hospital,” says Delhi-based cardiologist Dr Upendra Kaul, chairman of Batra Hospital and Medical Research Center . “There is no conclusive evidence, but there should be some science behind it. Particulate matter, cold weather and aggressive physical activities are associated with heart disease.”Not everyone agrees. Dr Thomas Alexander , director, STEMI India, an NGO that develops protocols and training modules for management of heart attacks, says patients may be ignoring minor symptoms or going to smaller centres where they are given medication. “It is safer to treat patients with medicines than take them for a procedure if it is not essential,” he says.",Curious case of fewer heart attacks during Covid-19,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75004951,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-184615,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/curious-case-of-fewer-heart-attacks-during-covid-19/articleshow/75004924.cms

During the lockdown period, FCI has brought in 10.7 lakh quintals of food grains from Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Odisha.
The state consumes only 70 lakh tonnes of food grains a year, but it produces about 1.15 crore tonnes of food grains annually.
The PDS outlets alone supplies about 3.3 lakh tonnes of rice a month.
Tamil Nadu people prefer consumption of rice varieties grown in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka,” said Subbaiyan.","The Covid-19 pandemic wreaking havoc across the globe and the nation going through an unprecedented lockdown have got people worried about possible short supply of essential commodities in the weeks to come. Giving credence to these fears, traders are jacking up prices of commodities in many markets anticipating a shortage. Halfway through the 21-day lockdown, prices of pulses and oil have gone up by ₹30-₹50 per kg. Tamil Nadu Foodgrain Merchants’ Association, S P Jeyapragasam said the available stock of dal, sugar, rice and rava in the open market may not last for more than 10 days.But the administration is not unduly worried. The state has enough stocks of essential commodities for supplying through PDS for the next three months. It has also lined up supplies to take care of the future requirement, said state food minister R Kamaraj. With four lakh tonnes of rice, 40,000 tonnes of sugar, 14,000 tonnes of dal and 8,000 tonnes of wheat available with the state civil supplies corporation, there is nothing to worry, said a senior official.Moreover, the Food Corporation of India (FCI), Tamil Nadu region, holds a stock of 24.6 lakh tonnes of food grains, which could take care of six months of PDS supply, said FCI general manager, J S Syju. During the lockdown period, FCI has brought in 10.7 lakh quintals of food grains from Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. Another 35 lakh quintals of food grains would be brought into Tamil Nadu in April and all incoming and outgoing trucks used for PDS supply are sanitized and disinfected to ensure safety of workers and beneficiaries, said Syju.The government’s efforts are now on ensuring adequate supplies in the open market, which accounts for about 60% of the total consumption of essential commodities in the state.Agriculture secretary Gagandeep Singh Bedi, agriculture director V Dakshinamoorthy, horticulture director N Subbaiyan and district collectors have been holding a series of interactions with private food processing companies, mill owners and traders in the past few days to streamline supplies in the open market.As a result, 1,900 of the 2,500 rice mills in the state have begun working. About 500 of 800 oil mills, 420 of 500 dal mills and 200 of 350 food processing units have resumed operations apart from 500 of 700 major bread and biscuit making units. As of now, they are running with skeletal strength to ensure supplies for the state, but depending on demand from other states, supplies can be scaled up any time, said Subbaiyan.What stands out perhaps is the village self-sufficiency programme started by the state horticulture department about a year ago. It goes back to the roots and giving a fresh lease of life to Mahatma Gandhi’s Gram Swaraj concept. “In our assessment, about 30% of the 17,800 revenue villages in the state were not cultivating vegetables and fruits a year ago. They were either buying vegetables from other places or villagers were limiting their vegetable consumption. In every revenue village, we started an initiative to grow vegetables in a minimum area of 25 acres and fruits in at least 5 acres. Today, more than 99% of villages in Tamil Nadu are self-sufficient in vegetable production and the balance 150 villages have attained about 50% self-sufficiency,” said Bedi.The state needs and produces about 6,000 tonnes of vegetables per day. While it transports about 2,000 tonnes to other states, it buys about the same quantity of onions and potatoes from other states to balance the supply. Various agencies have pressed into service several thousand mobile vegetable and fruit sales outlets across the state to help farmers reach out to consumers during the lockdown.Unless natural calamities wreak havoc, Tamil Nadu is a surplus state in food grain production too. The state consumes only 70 lakh tonnes of food grains a year, but it produces about 1.15 crore tonnes of food grains annually. The PDS outlets alone supplies about 3.3 lakh tonnes of rice a month. “Interestingly, we do not consume the rice we produce. It goes to Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Tamil Nadu people prefer consumption of rice varieties grown in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka,” said Subbaiyan. The Covid-19 crisis has pushed people into new food habits. People in cities have reduced intake of greens and fresh vegetable and increased consumption of pulses, potatoes and onions. On the other hand, with abundant vegetables at their disposal, villagers have increased their vegetable intake.Despite the viral attack, about 2.5 lakh acres in the state are under active cultivation. Braving shortage of farm workers and fertilizers, people are growing vegetables and fruits. The horticultural department has set a target of covering another 55,000 acres under cultivation this month alone and has issued orders to supply fertilizers through 9,871 outlets.","In the time of shortfall, TN’s granaries a relief","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75004835,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1165335,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/in-the-time-of-shortfall-tns-granaries-a-relief/articleshow/75004843.cms

He played a key role in containing the spread in Bangalore.","The Covid pandemic has disrupted life all over the world, and three week lockdown, despite being necessary, has created a set of problems of its own. There’s an aura of fear and paranoia in the atmosphere. But then, pandemics are not new to India. It’s just that advances in technology and hygiene have made us forget them.It was August 11 of 1898 and a train of the Southern Mahratta Railway chugged into Bangalore Cantonment from Bombay via Hubli. A railway loco superintendent, followed by his butler, disembarked at the station. The railways had physical screening for plague as the illness had spread in Bombay presidency then, and a police constable would escort the passenger home to ascertain their residence and had to report for checks for 10 consecutive days. Similarly, railway staff realised that the butler showed symptoms of the epidemic. He goes into history as the first patient in Bangalore when he was confirmed with plague the following day and died on August 15, 1898.British official PR Cadell’s Report on the Outbreak of Plague in Bangalore 1898-99 records this incident but also points to a train with grains halting at Bangalore city station around the same time. Authorities quarantined the load workers, 22 of them, to the good shed area (then Godownpet) to contain the disease. The approach seemed successful until September 9. After that, the plague went out of control, spreading rapidly to the Cottonpet and Akkipet areas. The Bangalore District Gazetteer of 1998 recorded the rapid rise of mortality in Bangalore from September 19 as 105 deaths per week. By October, 1,393 plague attacks were recorded and 2,807 died in the pete area alone. That December, the cantonment had 1547 casualties.The Bangalore yearly administration report of 1898-99 had recorded the government allotting Rs 2,45,790 as Plague Fund to control the epidemic and a Plague Commission being appointed. The municipality purchased 22 carts with 22 pairs of bullocks for Rs 2,565 and handed them over to new sweepers to remove dead bodies from drains, dustbins and even public toilets.The Commission began supervising plague control and observation through special camps set up on Magadi Road, then on the city outskirts. Celebrations and festivals were cancelled, the Yeswantpur railway station was converted into a medical inspection spot for persons coming into the city. Persons showing mild symptoms of plague were quarantined in 588 sheds for a 10-day period with compulsory segregation. Handbills and notices spreading awareness and explaining symptoms of the epidemic were distributed on bullock carts. Drains were cleaned, 18,438 houses disinfected, 651 houses declared inhabitable demolished and 36,259 people inoculated as plague prevention.Municipal authorities offered six annas for a dozen dead bandicoots, three annas for a dozen rats and two annas for a dozen mice - in an effort to reduce the rodent population, believed to be plague vectors. The reward remained in force till 1911.In 1896 as part of a city expansion plan, plots for sale were divided in Basavanagudi and Malleswaram layouts by local authorities. But there were hardly any takers. The plague epidemic in Bangalore drastically changed that with people who remained in the city during the spread moving to the two areas and pitching tents to escape the outbreak.“People were desperate for good and spacious living conditions, fresh water and wider roads like never before after witnessing the rampant spread of plague in cramped Petta areas. Thereafter, Basavanagudi and the Malleswaram areas that were mostly open grounds were occupied by people later leading to the development of the localities,” said Suresh Moona, city historian and columnist.Padmanabhan Palpu, a famous doctor and bacteriologist from Kerala, was posted as the first health officer for a monthly salary of Rs 400 during the plague outbreak. He played a key role in containing the spread in Bangalore. The Mysore Maharaja later felicitated Palpu for arduous service to state and he was instrumental in setting up the Victoria Hospital here.",How another pandemic gave rise to Karnataka’s health services,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74989528,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1233979,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/how-another-pandemic-gave-rise-to-karnatakas-health-services/articleshow/74989519.cms

They do their own thing all day, but at 6pm, Jain, her 78-year-old uncle Davinder Sood and aunt Peggy Sood get busy with Monopoly, Taboo or Scrabble.“We fight a lot about not accepting two-letter Scrabble words like ‘mo’ or ‘ab’? My uncle knows all of them and tries to play them, and my aunt always says, ‘if it’s a word, tell me what it means’,” says Jain.Board games are adding levity and fun to the lives of those stuck at home with their families for 21 days straight. These are also turning out to be a great way to get some pent-up energy (or resentment) out under the guise of friendly competition.Jain encourages her uncle and aunt to play charades or games that require them to act things out. “Aparna pushes our limits a little bit. One can get low being stuck in the house for so many days, so it’s nice to be doing activities and being silly. And we take pictures of ourselves doing it,” says Peggy Sood, who is an educator. Video game developer Asar Dhandala says board games have been keeping him sane. He lives with his cousins, and they get together every other day to play. “When the Janata Curfew happened, the entire family ended up playing the whole night, my parents, aunt and uncle included,” says the 25-year-old. If the entire family is playing, they opt for party games like Secret Hitler or Codenames. But if it’s just the cousins, they dig into a strategy game that lasts three to four hours.Leela Vinod Kumar is an avid board gamer who has been playing with his mom for half an hour every day and has been dabbling in solo games as well. “A lot of modern games come with an AI player where you can pick the difficulty level,” the software professional says. “There is a certain amount of fatigue that comes from looking at the screen.

While the family has been dabbling in all kinds of new, experimental games, they haven’t forgotten their nostalgia-inducing favourites such as Ludo, carrom and snakes and ladders — even carnival-inspired games where you win if you throw a ball into bottles.Vinita Sidhartha, who runs traditional board game company Kreeda Games, says the lockdown has given people time to do things they haven’t had time for. “In recent years, play has started to be considered frivolous, even with children.

The Ministry of External Affairs is also approaching suppliers in China for sourcing 10,000 ventilators from them.Ventilators are required for Covid-19 patients, as they tend to develop acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS).
Less than 20 covid-19 patients are on ventilator support at this moment, according to the health ministry.
As against this, over 14,000 ventilators have been identified in various hospitals across the country for treatment of Covid-19 patients, the ministry says.However, experts say the need for ventilators may rise exponentially.
Doctors must get proper protection as the cases are increasing,” said Dr Sameer Paltewar, director of Meditrina Institute.","NEW DELHI/NAGPUR: With the country worried about a shortage of ventilators , some innovative options are emerging. Dr Deepak Agrawal, professor of neurosurgery at AIIMS , and Diwakar Vaish, a robotics scientist, who previously developed what they claimed was the world’s cheapest ventilator ‘AgVa’ — which costs about Rs 1.5 lakh — told TOI they have improved upon this ventilator by incorporating a patent pending negative ion generator which inactivates the virus.At Nagpur’s New Era hospital, doctors have developed a tool with which eight patients can be put on one ventilator at the same time. Though ventilator splitters are not new, this one is said to be the first to serve eight patients at a time.The health ministry in a statement said on March 30 that they have placed an order to 1,000 ventilators from Agva Healthcare . “Supplies are expected to commence by the second week of April,” it added.“The inactivated virus is trapped at the expiratory end by a positive charge system thus protecting the environment,” Dr Agrawal said, who named his device AgVa COVID.The firm had received orders for over 50,000 ventilators from across the globe which it had to cancel due to sudden export ban on ventilators by the government, sources said.It is now channelising its resources to meet the needs of central and different state governments.The government has also placed an order for 30,000 ventilators from Bharat Electronics Limited which is going to collaborate with domestic manufacturers in this endeavour. “Indian auto manufacturers are also preparing to manufacture ventilators,” the government said. The Ministry of External Affairs is also approaching suppliers in China for sourcing 10,000 ventilators from them.Ventilators are required for Covid-19 patients, as they tend to develop acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS). Less than 20 covid-19 patients are on ventilator support at this moment, according to the health ministry. As against this, over 14,000 ventilators have been identified in various hospitals across the country for treatment of Covid-19 patients, the ministry says.However, experts say the need for ventilators may rise exponentially. “Two days ago, we made this ‘splitter’ with the use of computerized 3-D printing mechanism. Now, in case of emergency like mass casualty, we can ventilate eight patients with one ventilator. We can make more such splitters, if needed,” said Dr Anand Sancheti, director of New Era Hospital.Dr Sancheti stated that Samir and Siddharth Bhusari of Saras Life Solution Company in Butibori provided valuable technical support for this invention.Pulmonologist Dr Sameer Arbat has designed a safety box for performing difficult bronchoscopy procedures in suspected or confirmed Covid-19 patients.“Covid-19 spreads through coughing and sneezing, so it is very risky to perform bronchoscopy procedures in suspected or confirmed Covid-19 patients. The aerosols generated by a patient during such procedures can infect the doctor as well as spread in the surrounding area, thus infecting other patients,” said Dr Arbat.He worked on this design during lockdown and used only acrylic sheets and plastic materials available in the hospital as all vendors were shut. According to him, the prototype model has been already used and can be easily replicated by any doctor or hospital for treating patients of Covid-19.Dr Arbat said that he got the idea from some similar designs being used by doctors abroad. “I made an improvisation to make the box multipurpose for performing bronchoscopy as well as intubation procedures. I believe it is very economical to fabricate and should be useful for all doctors. It is advisable for the doctors and staff to wear proper personal protective equipment (PPE) for maximum safety,” he said.Nurses in Meditrina Institute of Medical Sciences made innovative use of the available material to design personal protection suite for them to deal with shortage of PPE kits and masks. “Necessity is the mother of invention. Our staff designed and stitched PPE kits right here in our hospital. I appreciated their effort. I know this is makeshift arrangement. Doctors must get proper protection as the cases are increasing,” said Dr Sameer Paltewar, director of Meditrina Institute.","In battle against corona, doctors turn to low-cost, innovative ventilators","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74958219,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-181870,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-battle-against-corona-doctors-turn-to-low-cost-innovative-ventilators/articleshow/74958213.cms

While women retire for the day, discussions at these choras range from local issues to national politics with puffs of bidis and masalas (lime-laced betelnut mixed with tobacco).The stringent lockdown order to curb novel coronavirus spread has not deterred villagers from holding these daily meetings. While cops are trying their best to ensure the lockdown, sarpanchs in some hamlets close to Rajkot have also realized the gravity of situation.

So, I had to use this method to ensure social distancing,” Jadeja, 39, told TOI.Dhulia Domda, an interior village with a population of just about 700, has seen an influx of natives coming from Rajkot, Ahmedabad and Surat after the corona outbreak in the cities, making social distancing even more important.Same was the situation in Virnagar village located on Rajkot-Bhavnagar highway where people threw caution to the wind and continued to sit at otlas for hours chatting with each other.Unable to stop them, Paresh Radadia, wife of sarpanch Daksha and a panchayat member himself, hit up on a rather prickly plan!. He used easily available the thorny gando baval (prosopis juliflora) to deter people from sitting in public places.“In order to end this menace and enforce social distancing among the villagers, I made labourers cut shoots of gando baval plants and heaped them on the otlas,” said Radadia.Virnagar with a population of nearly 7,000 has also witnessed an inflow of natives from Surat, many of whom could be potential carriers of the deadly virus.Tech to track, scare away crowdsRajkot: Burnt oil and thorns have significantly lessened social gatherings in both villages.

(The author is founder of Mental Health First Aid India)","Every news update on the deaths and exponential rise in the number of cases of Covid-19 is cause for mental stress, panic and anxiety among those waiting, watching and coping with the crisis unfolding globally.The lockdown to contain the disease has affected people in various ways, from livelihood to social life. But while governments and people try to cope with the crisis, mental health is not always the priority, when in fact pandemic outbreaks leave a deep impact on the mental health of a person and on society as a whole. The impact of a pandemic on mental health is far-reaching and can continue for years after it has ended.Well-known epidemiologist Dr Sandro Galea has written in his blog that during his work to control the SARS outbreak in 2004, he found “quarantined persons have a high prevalence of psychological distress, including symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. A key takeaway: Even if we can halt the physical spread of a disease through the expeditious use of quarantine and social distancing, we will still have to contend with its mental health effects in the long-term.”The psychopathology experienced by communities during a pandemic has been compared to that of a post-disaster effect. Most common mental health problems experienced during this time are post-traumatic stress, substance abuse, depression and other psychological symptoms such as phobias and anxiety and panic disorders. Comorbidities among the mental health problems have also been observed.Though humans have experienced pandemics throughout history, the most recent being the H1N1 or swine flu in 2009, the anxiety around Covid-19 is particularly high. This is possibly because there is no vaccine yet and people are scared of the high number of deaths in a short period of time. It is seen as a threat to the existence of the human race and many feel like the world is going to end.Easy contamination and spread of the virus when you are not symptomatic is increasing the sense of fear. Though people with obsessive compulsive disorder in India are less than 1%, but the constant warnings and advisory about contamination can have an adverse impact on them.The practise of isolation and social distancing has meant that people who had been leading active lives have been confined to their homes. As a result there has been a breakdown of the economy and a future of uncertainty hangs over some sections of the population, such as daily wage labourers, who feel vexed, frustrated and anxious. This is worse for those who work away from home.Adding to the issues on the ground is misinformation on social media, leading to mass panic and distress. A manifestation of which is panic buying with the spread of such fake news. Those propagating fail to understand that fake news can have a considerable impact on the mental health of individuals as well as a community leading to mob mentality or even riots.Historically mental health has not got due attention, creating a gap on the understanding and addressing of mental health problems as compared to physical illnesses. According the National Mental Health Survey , 1 in 10 people in India experience mental illness in their lifetime, 1 in 10 are diagnosed with depression and 6% of the population is at high risk of suicide. Unfortunately the gap of treatment of mental illness is as high as 83%. This results in a large number of people not accessing health services.Covid-19 can be called a traumatic event and for many it might not be easy to deal with and for the population living with mental illness it can worsen the situation.Therefore, the government should have the mental wellbeing of the people in mind as well when planning measures to check the spread of the virus. Increasing awareness of public about mental health as well as equipping them with first-aid skills could go a long way. The mental health system suffers from lack of systemic approach and vision of tackling mental health problems in the early stages.Stigma around mental health, fear of being judged as weak and poor awareness about mental health, results in many not realising that they have an illness. It is necessary that people have the basic knowledge to pick up signs and symptoms of emerging mental health issues. This is to ensure that they can reach out to others in need, just like they would for a physical ailment. Having a supportive conversation should be the next step to avoid an increase of incidence of suicides due to mental illness. With the right tools, prevention and early identification can be a shared responsibility of the government and people for a sound society.(The author is founder of Mental Health First Aid India)",Here’s why we should worry about what we are thinking,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74884751,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-180042,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/heres-why-we-should-worry-about-what-we-are-thinking/articleshow/74884752.cms

People think we are joking,"" said Sujan, a local farmer.With a population of around 9000 people, the village has a government primary school and is popularly known as the first halt of the Chaurasi (84) Kosi parikrama - a pilgrimage that is undertaken by thousands a fortnight before Holi festival every year.As the village is provided with most of basic amenities like electricity and water supplied through tankers during the Parikrama, the village appears like a suburban locality.While most of the men in the village - 80 km from Lucknow - work as daily-waged labourers, others are into agriculture and own farmland as well.",Namesake?

Last year, a report by fitness solutions firm Fitbit, based on user data from 18 countries- revealed that India was the second- most sleep deprived country in the world. Corroborating it was a recent study released by Bengaluru-based company, Wakefit.co. The third edition of the study titled the Great Indian Sleep Scorecard (GISS) 2020 revealed poor sleep patterns in the major cities. Bengaluru topped the chart. For a country that luxuriated in its afternoon siestas, and where a snooze under the copious branches of a banyan or neem tree was par for course, these statistics are alarming.Dr Arun Sasidharan, a neuroscientist with the Neurophysiology department in NIMHANS , has been studying sleep for the past 10 years. Sasidharan says that the field of sleep medicine is now slowly picking steam. “Sleep medicine is gaining more traction, but the favourite subject of researchers seems to be sleep disorders,” he says. “The number of sleep disorders has risen from 60 disorders to 87 now, and the number is expected to rise to 120 disorders.”“If you look back in history, our early ancestors up until medieval times, people tended to sleep early, by 6 or 7 pm because their lives tended to revolve around the sun. Things changed once Edison invented the bulb. Daylight was available for longer, and in the last 100 years, with the internet and more means of consumption via devices people are pushing their sleep further,” explains Dr Swami Subramaniam pharmacologist , neurologist and author of Mastering Sleep.“People tend to valorise hard work. And until recently, statements like ‘I did an allnighter’ had fashionable connotations,” Subramaniam says. “I have people who come to the gym without having properly rested. They think that exercise is important for staying fit, while ignoring sleep which is a mis-conception,” says Rishabh Telang, fitness expert with Cure.Fit. In terms of importance, Telang ranks sleep before diet and exercise.“It is during your sleep state that your body produces the growth hormone which helps in breaking fat storage, regulating muscle growth, and improving immunity.” Telang says. On the negative side, “disrupted or incomplete sleep aids in production of the stress hormone cortisol which could cause obesity among other issues,” he says. “Your brain cleans itself of metabolic fluid that collects around the nerves at night, much like a washing. When you sleep well, you are helping the brain with the process,” says Subramaniam before adding, “Sleep is the most pleasant, cheapest, and safest activity one can think of. There is no toxicity involved; neither can you overdose on it.

But this is something people everywhere are forced to do. S Mithun had never thought he could take on the role of a hairdresser , but stuck at home during a lockdown when his eight-year-old wanted a trim, Mithun took up the challenge.Not impressed with a simple cut, his son insisted on the more stylised look of two shaved lines.

CoSara, a joint venture between Indian and US firms, was the first Indian company to receive a preliminary licence to produce testing kits despite a lack of clarity over its US FDA certification.
In contrast, South Korea is testing 20,000 samples a day.But there is some positive news on the testing front for India.
Pune-based MyLab is the first Indian company to receive approval to manufacture testing kits.
NIV and ICMR have evaluated at least 14 testing kits.","On Thursday, WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said lockdowns implemented across the world alone won’t be enough to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. Lockdowns merely created a “second window of opportunity” to tackle the virus by expanding testing.But testing has been a challenge. Shortages of test kits, in particular, have hindered governments’ response to the crisis. It’s the same story in India but the consequences could be far more dire here than elsewhere. TOI looks at how testing works and why there have been shortages across the world.The global shortage in test kits can be attributed to several factors — scarcity of supplies, slow approvals processes, and skyrocketing demand outstripping production capacities.As the world races to produce more tests, essential supplies have become scarce. Shortages in chemicals used in the kits have caused manufacturing delays. The lockdown and flight restrictions in India have limited the imports of tests, the movement of supplies within the country and the transport of samples to testing labs.In India, the government approval process has been a major limiting factor. Initially, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had said only testing kits with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European CE certifications would be permitted. This effectively cut out almost all Indian manufacturers while possibly favouring foreign-based producers. As a result, though India-based Trivitron had sold 5 lakh tests to China earlier, it is yet to receive approval from Indian authorities.This policy was also at the centre of the CoSara controversy. CoSara, a joint venture between Indian and US firms, was the first Indian company to receive a preliminary licence to produce testing kits despite a lack of clarity over its US FDA certification. CoSara reportedly has European CE certification but is yet to be approved by Indian authorities.Later, the policy was changed to allow manufacturers to have their tests validated by the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.The shortage is the primary reason India, among several countries, has conducted very few tests given the size of its population. As of March 27, India had conducted 26,798 tests. At about 19 tests per million people, India has conducted among the fewest tests across the world. West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on March 23 said her state had just 40 testing kits.Thus far, India has met its testing requirements primarily by using kits developed by NIV. It was also importing tests developed by Swiss firm Roche and has placed orders for at least a million more from WHO. It is unclear how many tests are available in India. Earlier reports suggested NIV had only one lakh tests available.Some experts say the shortage has helped shape India’s narrow testing criteria — only those with travel history to affected areas or those who came in contact with a Covid-19 positive person are being tested. Ultimately, this resulted in very few people being tested. On March 20, ICMR expanded the criteria to include symptomatic healthcare workers and other high-risk individuals.But testing in India is also being limited to avoid overburdening its weak healthcare system. With 11.5 lakh allopathic doctors in the country, there is just one doctor per 10,000 people. WHO recommends at least one doctor per 1,000 people.Currently, the government testing capacity stands at about 10,000 samples a day. In contrast, South Korea is testing 20,000 samples a day.But there is some positive news on the testing front for India. Pune-based MyLab is the first Indian company to receive approval to manufacture testing kits. MyLab says its tests will cut down diagnosis time to 2.5 hours from the current six to seven hours. The company also said it can produce up to one lakh tests in a week and that each would cost Rs 1,200 — below the health ministry’s price cap of Rs 4,500. Germany-based Altona was also approved. NIV and ICMR have evaluated at least 14 testing kits. More approval announcements are expected in the next week.Trivitron, which had supplied tests to China, said it has the capacity to produce between 500 and 75,000 tests a day. CoSara, despite the controversy surrounding it, said it can manufacture 10,000 tests per day starting in April.The government is also expanding testing facilities. Until recently, only government labs were allowed to test samples. At least 60 private labs with 15,000 collection centres will be added to ICMR’s 100-odd existing facilities.The most widely used test uses polymerase chain reaction or PCR, a technique invented in the 1980s. Central to PCR is its ability to “amplify” DNA — multiply genetic material into large enough quantities to analyse. In the case of the coronavirus, the virus’ RNA first needs to be converted to DNA using an enzyme called reversetranscriptase before putting samples into a PCR machine. Samples collected in throat and nasal swabs are mixed with reagents, which are particles that bind to the virus’s genetic material to ensure no other type of DNA in the sample is amplified. Next, the sample is placed in the PCR machine, which uses cycles of heating and cooling to help the reagents amplify the target DNA into millions of copies. A fluorescent dye is added — the dye glows if the result is positive.",Coronavirus: Why testing has been slow to take off,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74856834,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-179192,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/coronavirus-why-testing-has-been-slow-to-take-off/articleshow/74856812.cms

This is a nation where modern medicine is the youngest among eight coexisting and distinct systems of medicine, each with its own logic, validity, and ardent followers. Yet such columnists ignore the jagged interface between medical disciplines. Real medical science requires translation into clinical practice. They ignore clinical realities, such as the successful use of urine therapy’s nitrogen to clear the gut. They are not interested in understanding healing or creating larger frames of reference to resolve inconsistencies.Modern physicians cry quackery though their own medicines cannot show patients how to control chronic diseases or treat cancers. Ancient Sanskrit texts contain some of the human race’s oldest preserved clinical wisdom. Why ignore these texts by branding them as religion? Is it because scientists can’t understand the logic, or patent formulations as intellectual property?Frontier research in neuroscience, oncology gastroenterology and pulmonology today points to more effective treatments than just surgery, pharmaceuticals and radiation. Examples include panchakarma, thermography, acupuncture , laser therapies, molecular pleotropism, electromagnetic-field therapies, and herbal medicines. Scientific studies ground their clinical usefulness. Where are the studies for antibiotics used for viral infections? And for combination use of pharmaceuticals that have never been tested for drug-drug interactions?Hundreds of scientific references describe the anti-viral properties in Indian plants such as guduchi, haldi, neem, in the laboratory and the clinic. Vaidyas use guduchi at the change of seasons, rtusandhi when summer arrives with its flux of viruses. Herbs that work in the gut are used to keep the digestion clean, the gut microbiome happy, and prevent the immune system from being preoccupied with indigestible antigens. The proof is in the morning toilet and sink. No clinical trial needed.Herbs for prana-vaha-srotas (ENT+respiratory channel) resolve patients’ self-reported post-nasal drip and respiratory discomforts. The herbs tulsi, vasa, neem, licorice, kantakari, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom and long pepper have been observed for their effects on the lung, and analysed for a dozen centuries. Placebo? Who cares when the throat feels better the same day?It is not unscientific to use herbs. It is unscientific to deny their existence, when the scientific clinical literature is full of good studies. The best scientific sources admit that, unlike pharmaceutical drugs which are usually one chemical, herbal medicines contain pleiotropic molecules (a single molecule affects many molecular mechanisms, usually in different parts of the body). It is also unscientific not to visit PubMed to search for scientific studies on herbs before making comments that herbs have no scientific basis.Market power should also speak loudly to rationalists. Over 700,000 Ayurvedic physicians and their patients use herbal formulations. People in the West spend billions of dollars to get herbs. If herbal “unproven” medicines did not work clinically, why would highly educated people continue to use them? They can use anything, yet choose “alternative medicines”, rejecting the easy-to-get, almost free pharmaceuticals. Something other than placebo is at play.Varma attempts to define real medicine as treatments that work, using outdated ideas of epidemiology. Most scientist-clinicians and epidemiologists in the Cochrane Collaboration admit that double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised-clinical-trials are not the best way to judge the true effectiveness of all treatments, but they surrender with, ‘it is what we have’. They also admit that placebo-control designs are biased in favour of pill-based interventions, which can be single-, double-, or triple-blinded.Many clinical studies have surpassed study design barriers and shown yoga and reiki to be clinically as good or better than “evidence-based” pharmaceutical medicine. The NIH Consensus Conference on Acupuncture was published in JAMA in 1998, showing acupuncture as excellent for asthma.The defence of peer-reviewed journals in modern medicine is also debunked when major publishers admit that many studies are financially incentivised, promoting manipulated data, and not a scientific gold standard. The assertion that “no homoeopathic medicine has ever passed” the placebo test is outdated. Several RCTs show that homoeopathy works. The greater problem is that the medical physics of water and dilutions cannot yet be explained by biochemists . Yet chemists and physicists accept blindly that water has unexplained properties in vivo.Unproven medicines remain unproven, just as India remains Covid-free while it remains untested: when proper tools will be used correctly, to test accurately, by competent people, true data will emerge.How can we generate clinical evidence about Ayurveda when properly designed studies are not funded, when the committees that fund them are composed of single-discipline scientists full of bias, and when proper training and ethical research are not standard among “experts”?In this nation, where plural medical systems highlight its commitment to diversity, respect for ancient wisdom, and infinite potential, the bias of claiming all therapies as quackery when they don’t match the ideology of the best-funded system is simply that — bias.The patient ultimately seeks relief. Most do not care which system they follow, if their treatment really works.The writer is MPH MD (Family Medicine) PhD (Ayurveda-BHU), and Fulbright Specialist in Global Public Health/Integrative Medicine 2018-2021",Alternative medicine isn’t quackery.

When both couples work, they usually give over domestic duties to a cleaning lady or cook — and now, they’re dealing with it all at once.The lockdown has made us realise how our small household of two working adults, one school-going six-year-old, and one attention seeking dog, are so dependent on multiple people, says Anjalli Ravikumar, social mission director at Unilever. This includes a nanny (“who, sadly for her, is locked down with us”) and maid and driver and various ‘wallahs’ — for doodh, bread, eggs, dhobi, nariyal, gaadi ki safai and so on, she says.Nandita Mehta (name changed), a chirpy and sociable communications professional, says she’s “already super-fried” living in lockdown. “I really miss the interaction at work, now stuck 24x7 in a small space”.

She’s grateful that she can still take a walk in the park outside, and find a brief sense of autonomy.If division of labour was a prickly point before isolation, brace for serious chore wars between working couples now. Having to care for restless children while putting on a professional front for that virtual meeting can be hard. “My 12-year-old son can sit for hours with a screen, but my six-yearold daughter is a bouncing ball of energy, she just climbs up the gate and runs out” says Lalita Singh, a home-maker. “I’ve told her that if she leaves the house, she stays out. That’s done the job for now,” she says.“I've replaced my yoga time with jhadoo pocha which, to let you in on a dirty secret, only gets done every alternate day,” says Ravikumar. She is learning to cook from online recipes. “The husband is finally putting his IIT-IIM education to use and is responsible for managing my daughter’s online lessons. The school, a wonderful IB school, requires parents to reference at least four different kinds of apps and website to figure out the lessons for the week, and upload completed work as proof. It’s mental,” she says. Her dog, she says, is the most “mentally stabilising chap to have around right now because he’s so oblivious to everything — “I don’t care about Covid, where’s my chicken?”Some people are actively leaning into the lockdown disruption, like Shubhendu Kumar , who works at a headhunting firm. When their help stopped coming, Kumar, his wife and daughter immediately divided up the jhadoo-pocha, dishwashing and cooking between them. “I see it as a fun experience.

He’s happy not to be commuting, his daughter is thrilled that her board exam was postponed and that she’s got her phone back for PUB. “This experience is revealing so much about our personalities.

India has pledged to restore 8 million hectares by 2030, of which Tamil Nadu has committed to work on about one million hectares.
It is called classical forest management which tries to convert the forest into stock one.
While the forest cover in Tamil Nadu is estimated to be 26,281sqkm, the tree cover outside forests is 4,671sqkm.
It is the tree cover outside forests in private lands which can be improved.","Forests support 80% of all species on land, but efforts to protect them have been largely wrong, leading to further degradation. Forest management today needs to be a priority and more importantly requires a revamp. It needs to be about conserving biodiversity with scientific focus and involvement of indigenous tribal communities rather than about artificial afforestation that promotes monoculture and is only about timber and firewood.This year’s theme on World Forest Day, observed on March 21, was forests and biodiversity. In recent years, Tamil Nadu has focussed on protecting forest landscapes, similar to the Bonn Challenge – a global effort to bring 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested land under restoration by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030. The Bonn Challenge lays emphasis on landscape approaches— a model aimed at improving the ecology of a landscape as a whole to benefit local livelihood and conservebiodiversity. India has pledged to restore 8 million hectares by 2030, of which Tamil Nadu has committed to work on about one million hectares. To achieve this, a vibrant mechanism will have to be put in place in Tamil Nadu to plan, execute, continuously monitor and follow up genuine, active, participatory forest management to achieve zero deforestation and ensure a forest with an improved variety of tree species.Till now, the management of Indian forests and Tamil Nadu, in particular, has been about limited protective functions and mostly focused on production forestry, where focus is on produce such as timber and firewood.This flawed forest management, a colonial legacy, deals with growing stock, increment and yield regulation for commercial purposes. It is called classical forest management which tries to convert the forest into stock one. For instance, forests have been cut down and in their place eucalyptus plantations raised, under the pretext of afforestation. But in nature no such forests exist. Afforestation in this case is a misnomer, since a forest is about a diverse range of species and not a single one.The objectives of forest management in Tamil Nadu are elucidated in National Forest Policy 1988 and the state forest Policy of Tamil Nadu 1918. The forest management in Tamil Nadu is at a crossroads and lacks clear strategy and action to achieve the objectives of these policies. The classical forest management followed till now to achieve the objectives are inadequate. Therefore, the forest management strategy and action must be completely transformed to meet the present and future ecological needs of Tamil Nadu.A brave and bold decision to revamp the forest management in Tamil Nadu is long overdue and must be attended to at the earliest for conservation of biodiversity and better ecological security of the state. It must be conservation oriented, nature based and community centric. Preservation of the forest with all their ecological, social, and productive functions with active participation of people must replace the commercial, classical forest management in practice for more than a century.It is obvious from the state of forests that the traditional forest management has become scientifically obsolete and it has been having deleterious effects on remaining forests. The new approach should be a forest management based on nature and led by people (FMNP).The National Forest Policy, 1988, envisages that the area under forest and tree cover should be enhanced to 33% of the geographical area of the country. The State Forest Policy, 2018 of Tamil Nadu also stipulates that it will formulate strategies for increasing the forest and tree cover from the present level of 23.8% of the geographical area of the state to 33%. While the forest cover in Tamil Nadu is estimated to be 26,281sqkm, the tree cover outside forests is 4,671sqkm. The possibility of increasing forest cover is impossible. It is the tree cover outside forests in private lands which can be improved. The challenge is to increase the tree cover to an extent of 9,000sqkm. We must take action to plant and maintain 40 crore seedlings in private and common lands in another eight years to achieve 33% forest and tree cover in Tamil Nadu. The need of the hour is a brown revolution, on lines of green and white revolution, provided tree management is taken outside the Forest Act 1882.",Turning back time to grow natural forests,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74807323,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-197130,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/turning-back-time-to-grow-natural-forests/articleshow/74807286.cms

Fewer people are likely to get infected with Covid-19 if the residents comply with the lockdown and follow social distancing Dr Mohan Leslie Noone, neurologist, Baby Memorial Hospital, Kozhikode, who analysed data from certain worst affected countries like Italy, the US and the UK, as well as countries like Singapore and South Korea, which managed to contain the virus, said timely lockdown and stringent measures were the key factors that helped them reduce infection rates.By looking at growth in the number of new cases, it is clear that Singapore has been the most successful in handling the situation, followed by South Korea. “Both countries did extensive testing and implemented strict home quarantine, using technology as well as legal force. Singapore, additionally, admitted and isolated all positive cases, even mild ones, to prevent the spread of the virus. As a result, they didn’t have to go for extensive lockdown because they managed to lock away the positive cases exceptionally well,” said Dr Noone.No surprise then that the central and state governments are asking people to maintain self-discipline. “Each day is important now and we can’t take any chances. Even as the government is taking all necessary steps to prevent the spread of the disease, it is the social responsibility of every person in the state to stay at home and maintain social distance,” said state nodal officer (public emergency), currently in charge of anti-Covid-19 effort in the state.“There are multiple factors that is going to influence the progress of the infection. The next two-three weeks is very crucial as there can be rapid community spread. Indian government, through lockdown and various other measures, is trying to flatten the curve and to ensure that there is no sudden rise in cases, so that our health system can manage them,” said Dr Prabhakaran, epidemiologist and vice-president, research and policy, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), Delhi.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the number of cases worldwide has surpassed 3,30,000, while the number of deaths has exceeded 14,000. In a densely populated country like India, the infection spread would be severe.Dr Noone added that surge in incidents of death due to Covid-19 can happen either suddenly or late, depending on healthcare facilities. Mortality due to Covid-19 ranges from 2-5%, with Italy registering highest because they ran out of hospital beds and had an aging population.On Tuesday, the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economies and Policy of John Hopkins University came out with new estimates that shows that if we fail to comply with lockdown, then by April 25, many in the state may be infected with Covid-19, with a large number needing hospitalization.

But there’s a lot of chirping in the air, especially over the waterbodies, thanks to the serenity that has emboldened birds to come out into the open and return to their habitat.Experts say the number of birds visiting Bengaluru’s lakes has increased in the past week only because the waterbodies aren’t being frequented by people. northern shoveler, painted storks, Indian cormorants and spot billed pelicans, among other birds have landed in Sadaramangala Lake in Whitefield after a gap of nearly four years.Pallavi Sharma, a lake activist working for the betterment of Sadaramangala Lake, said, “About 15 days ago when I visited the lake, I could spot only two species of birds, but when I visited the place on Monday, I could spot six different species of birds. If a few days of leaving their habitat alone can do this, one can only imagine how many species would return if we humans don’t interfere with nature.”Ramprasad V, an expert on lakes, said, “It simply shows that by keeping away from the lakes for three days we are able to bring back the birds. Those preparing detailed project reports for reviving lakes should now understand that putting unnecessary lights can disrupt the biodiversity of lakes.”Birds have been visiting many other waterbodies — Doddabommasandra Lake, Yelahanka Lake and Vidyaranyapura Lake — in larger numbers over the past week. They tend to shy away from places where there is a lot of noise and lights. The best way is to let them be.Many lake experts believe humans not only pollute the lakes but also interfere with the natural habitat of many species and with most of the city staying indoors, birds are slowly returning to their natural habitat. Most of the aquatic life is in the shallow waters near lake banks and avian visitors to such spots thrive by feeding on this aquatic life, they say, adding that when humans try to build a concrete wall on the shores the eco-system is lost.Leo Saldanha from Environment Support Group said, “The moment we convert lakes into parks and recreational centres there is a decrease in bird activity. The moment we stop activities such as tourism and boating there is an increase in bird activity, especially the migratory ones.”Ornithologist MB Krishna said, “Silence and drop in the number of visitors and traffic would surely encourage birds to fly into greener spaces.

BENGALURU: An Amul advertisement sans the chubby little girl, the Nirma ad without the girl swirling in a pretty white frock and the Starbucks logo where the twin-tailed mermaid is missing. All these and more, captioned: Everyone around the world has gone home, why are you still here?A campaign by Ananya Bashyam, 18, a first-year student of National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), on social distancing is gaining popularity. In the campaign, she tweaks popular advertisements/logos to spread the message of social distancing.“I realised Gen Z can’t relate to most of the government advisories. Millennials do not listen if they are just given a list of rules to follow. They need humour to notice things. Even the colour palette and the artwork that the older generation likes need not resonate with youngsters. They should be quirky and relatable to things that we grow with. That’s how I took to these extremely classic Indian logos,” said Ananya.With the campus shutting and students being asked to leave in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak, Ananya, who is from Hyderabad, is back home. “I am loaded with class work. But when work on the Adobe software gets too much, I shift to other stuff as a stressbuster. I have been working on comics and recently visited the Indian Cartoon Gallery.

There were times an unsolved piece of puzzle would keep him from moving on to a chore at hand for hours together. But over the last decade, social media and PS4 caught up with life, and the puzzles found a spot on the loft, as Mozim left for VIT to study computer science.But ever since the lockdown, as life moved back into the slow lane and mothers, fathers, grandparents and children sit home together, the lost love for board games has been rekindled. Today, designated hours are spent by Mozim every afternoon solving at least one 1000-piece puzzle – in addition to a game of Scrabble, playing cards and Monopoly. ""It suddenly feels like the years never passed by,"" he says. ""It gets especially interesting when mom and dad join the game and make it competitive. These sessions remind us why we loved our game sessions as kids.""Even as on the one hand, virtual games gain popularity during the lockdown, families are finding a new sense of purpose and excitement learning and playing traditional games like pallanguzhi , on the other.City architect Priya Narayanan has made it a point to slip in a game of Adu Puli Attam – a strategic two-player game – in between sessions of chess with her kids and husband. ""I have fond memories growing up playing Adu Puli Attam and Pallanguzhi. My family loves board games already, and I realized it’s only a matter of igniting interest in newer kinds of games. And I thought, what better time to do it than now,"" says Priya.At a time when people may have forgotten the pleasures of real-time interactions and slowing down, sitting together and playing these games brings loved ones together and lightens things up at an otherwise gloomy time.When 29-year-old marketing professional Felix Calis started playing Poker with his roommates four days ago, it was simply to kill the long hours sitting at home. But now, he’s convinced they’ve gotten to know each other in a way they didn’t over the last many years. ""It’s a strategy game and interestingly you learn to see how people think.
